Problem: Organize all At-Home Workouts in one place

General App Idea/Purpose: An app that allows me to catalogue all of my At-Home Workouts by category. I no longer have to have serveral tabs open of all of the workouts I want to complete for the day. All of the workouts that I love are all in one place. This cuts down on time spent being physically inactive searching for the workouts (which typically leads to me wanting to take a very long break that results in me pushing the workout off until later, haha!).

Who Whould Use it? People who love to use specific workouts at home. 

Technologies Used:
    CSS
    JS
    EJS
    Node.js
    Express
    MongoDB

Unsolved Problems: 1) I created a login page, but it was taking me a little bit longer that I expected to get it to authenticate. I would like to go back to fix that. 2) Add more styling. 3) Add Google Maps.
